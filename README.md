# Treap Data Structure

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a **Treap** â€” a randomized balanced binary search tree that combines binary search tree (BST) and heap properties. Treaps support efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with good average-case performance.

## Features

- Implementation of Treap data structure
- Supports insertion, deletion, and search operations
- Maintains balanced tree properties using randomized priorities
- Demonstrates core concepts of treaps for educational and practical purposes

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tasfiul-Hedayet/Treap.git
